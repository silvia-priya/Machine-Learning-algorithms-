Comparative study about Decision trees,Random forest,NVB,SVM

This exercise is all about comparing the different supervising machine learning algorithms like Decision trees,Random forest,Naive byes,Support vector machine. 

The data  is of size 1.5MB and it contains details about the different leaves and plants and its measurements. All we need to do is classify them based on the measurements tracked. Different classsifying algorithms works in different approaches and we need to build a model and measure their accuracy.
